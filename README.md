### Six Deck blackjack

In six deck blackjack, six decks are shuffled and used.
The player is allowed to place a bet, given they have enough funds.
Blackjack pays 3-to-2 and a regular winning hand pays 1-to-1.

The player will always be dealt 2 cards to start while the dealer will only shows for 1 card.
